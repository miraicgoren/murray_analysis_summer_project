# murray_analysis_summer_project
All the code and analysis for my project on ICA bifurcations and Murrayâ€™s Law. Used TopCoW 2024 dataset, semi-automated pipeline with 3D Slicer, extracted vessel diameters, calculated deviation and exponent k, and stat analysis to see how geometry differs across CT and MR.
