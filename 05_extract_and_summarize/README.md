***05) Extracting Diameters***

**extract_diameters_only.py:**
Main code for extracting the diameters of each branch. It takes the cross-section CSVs for curve 0 (ICA), curve 1, and curve 2, decides which daughter is ACA vs MCA. Then it finds a stable stretch of each curve where the cross-section area doesn’t jump around much (it smooths the series and applies a small variation threshold). Inside that stable span it averages circle-equivalent diameters (CE diameters) and radii and computes a roundness measure. It also saves a QC plot that marks the chosen span. Results are saved in _diam_summary_full.csv_, a run log is saved in _diam_log_full.txt_, and any problems (such as missing CSVs or “no stable span”) are listed in _diam_failures.csv_. Possible to adjust the smoothing window, span length, and threshold in the script.
